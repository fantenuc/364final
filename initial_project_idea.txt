This application allows users to register and sign into the application to ensure that only they can see their data and not other users that are signed up for the application. The New York Times Movie Review API will be invoked so that the users can view movie reviews based on the search term they input into the application. These reviews and search terms will be saved onto their own account. Since the application is returning movies to the user based on what they search for, the user will be able to create their own collections of movies so that they can go back and view specific movies that they saved, for example, under a 'Good Reviews - Should Watch Later' collection. Users will also be able to delete a collection after they do not want to see it anymore. The users can see all the movie reviews they have saved and the collections they have made but cannot see other users' searches or collections.
